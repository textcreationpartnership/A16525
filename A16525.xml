         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               </gap>ke vpon the wedneſdaies and fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies, with the reſt of our people &amp; flocke committed vnto vs: there and then to be occupied in praier and faſting, to intreat the Lord for our ſinnes, and for the ſinnes of the reſt in this land: that ſo his heauie hand, which by the peſtilence was then very ſharpely, and that a long time ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched out in many cheife cities and towns of this realme, and namely, of this your L. Dioces, as Norwich, and Yarmouth, and ſome other might be called in at his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time,<note place="margin">Sam. 24.16.</note> as it was in the daies of king Dauid. Whereby it came to paſſe, that both here, and in many places els, there was much more preaching &amp; hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the word of God, and praying vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, then was before, and otherwiſe would haue beene. So that by meanes of the ſtraite charge laid vpon all by your L. letter, there was much good done in this countrie at that time, the fruite whereof
<pb facs="tcp:15175:3" rendition="simple:additions"/> I hope, remaineth vnto this day. For though the booke containing the cauſe and order of thoſe faſts, which was made by ſome of the cheife gouernours in the Church of England, and was authorized by the Kings Highneſſe, did (as I take it) not onely giue leaue vnto all places pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely to meete vpon theſe aboue named daies to theſe ends, but did inioyne them to it: and ſo all men might haue taken knowledge of it, and of their dutie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in from thence: eſpecially when the cauſe of it (namely ſo grieuous, and ſo vniuerſall a plague) was ſo notorious, that it could not be hid from any: yet it was found too true by experience in many places, that vntill ſuch time as men were further cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vpon by your Lordſhips letter, full of great and weightie reaſons to perſwade thereunto, that neither many miniſters had any care to call vpon their people to ſo holy and neceſſarie a ſeruice, nor the people any great deuotion to come: So ſlowe are men vnto any part of Gods ſeruice, yea though it doth ſo greatly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
<pb facs="tcp:15175:4" rendition="simple:additions"/> them, eſpecially to this principall part of it in faſting and praier (which hath beene very long out of vſe) that they had neede not onely lightly to be called vpon, but with many ſtrong coards violently hailed vnto it: though vnto all matters of the world, they are ſo forward and haſtie, that they runne of their own accord, and none can ſtay them. Hereupon it hath come to paſſe, that a great part of the good, that this way hath beene done vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the people of God, and ſeruice to his maieſtie, is to be imputed vnto your lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips diligent care, who did ſo timely, and effectually ſtirre vp men vnto it: eſpecially in reſpect of thoſe cheife places &amp; others, vnder your Lordſhips iuriſdiction, which then were greatly ſubiect vnto this viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as well as other parts of this land, neither are they all of them yet free from it. Therefore theſe beeing part of my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours at that time, they are in ſome ſort due vnto your Lordſhip, by whoſe means I receiued incouragement thereunto, as others did to the like. And I haue preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb facs="tcp:15175:4" rendition="simple:additions"/> to preſent them vnto your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, that by them you may ſee, and by one may iudge of the reſt, how readie we are, and ſhall be, to yeild obedience to all your L. godly proceedings: promiſing for my ſelfe, and preſuming of the reſt that when we ſhall be likewiſe comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded (which we expect, and hope for in time) to keepe ſolemne dayes of thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing for the mitigating of this plague in ſo great meaſure in the moſt places, and for the cleane taking of it away in many, we will be, by the grace of God, as ready to performe that part of ſeruice, as we haue beene forward vnto this. And in the meane ſeaſon according to our boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den duty we will indeauour not only pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatly to be thankfull vnto God, but vpon all ſuch daies, as we haue our publike aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, to doe it in ſome part, and to call vpon our people to be thankfull to God with vs, both in hart, words, and life: leaſt the Lord for our vnthankfulnes doe returne vpon vs with the ſame, or ſome other great puniſhment of his. Which
<pb facs="tcp:15175:5" rendition="simple:additions"/> we haue ſo much the more cauſe to feare, vnles we thus ſeeke to preuent it, becauſe the late memory of ſo great a worke, both of iuſtice in ſending the plague, and of mercy in taking it away, is not ſo freſh &amp; effectuall with all men, nay with very few, as it ſhould: but they like to vngratious children ſo ſoone forget the rodd, as it is off their back. And ſeeing by theſe your Lordſhip may take knowledge, that by your godly incitation many were made more painfull in their callings (at the leaſt for that time) then otherwiſe they would have beene, whereby alſo God was more honoured, and the people more inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: your Lordſhip will according to that high place, wherein God hath placed you, eſpecially to that end, take all oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities by word and writing ſtill to incite all men to be zealous and feruent in the worke of the miniſtery: by giuing all good incouragement vnto the painfull la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers in Gods harueſt, and by quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vp them that are any way ſlothfull and negligent, and by diſcountenancing
<pb facs="tcp:15175:5" rendition="simple:additions"/> them that are altogether careles and idle, and by ſtopping vp the paſſage vnto al idol ſheapherds &amp; hirelings, who ſeeke the fleece and not the flock: whoſe right arme as it is cleane withred vp, and their right eye vtterly darkned ſo as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſaith they haue neither will,<note place="margin">Zach. 11.17.</note> nor abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie to doe any good in the Church of God. That ſo not only the goſpell may ſtill more and more be purely preached in this your Lordſhips Dioces, (as now by the grace of God it is, and hath beene a long time by many learned &amp; great men) but that the people in all places may be compelled diligently to frequent it: &amp; not only themſelues to yeeld obedience vnto it, but to haue their children &amp; ſeruants,<note place="margin">Act. 10.2.</note> euen their whole families willingly cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſed: that they may feare God with all their houſehoulds. That ſo we may bleſſe god, not only for your comming among vs, but much more for your continuance with vs, and ouer vs: and pray to him for you (as we doe, and mind to doe) that the Lord will long preſerue you zealous of

            <p>WHen as of late this holy exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of faſting, was by publike authoritie, not without iuſt cauſe impoſed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs (welbeloued fathers and brethren) I thought it conuenient, or rather neceſſarie for that people, which then I had to deale with (and haue still) firſt of all to make them acquainted with the nature of it, not ſo much by preaching of faſting out of ſome one text, (which could not very fitly haue beene done) as by deliuering vnto them in ſundrie ſermons the whole doctrine of it orderly, out of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places of holy Sc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

And thus in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of theſe ſhort treatiſes and Homilies at the first I had reſpect only vnto them. Since I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering on the one ſide the great ignorance that is in moſt places, as of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther partes of gods ſeruice which are ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſo moſt of all this, which is extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, eſpecially becauſe it is, and hath beene ſo much out of vſe: and then waying on the other ſide, that there may be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after great cauſe offered vnto vs againe of vſing this holy &amp; excellent ordinance of god, either publikely in many places, or priuately in more, ſeeing that this viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the plague doth ſo linger, like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the leaproſy which ſometime did hang long in the howſes of the Iewes, and ſoe doth very ſhortly, or not at all wholy depart from ſome places: beſides thoſe new chaſtiſements, which we know not how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny or how ſoone they may come vpon vs: I thought ſince, that both for theſe, and for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:15175:8" rendition="simple:additions"/> cauſes theſe my labours might be not wholly vnprofitable to all thoſe, that are well minded. And thought I cannot be ignorant that there are many and godly and learned ſermons and treatiſes, both in engliſh and latine, already extant of this argument, and ſo my indeauour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them may ſeeme ſuperfluous: yet all things conſidered, I doubt not, but that ſome may ſtand in neede of theſe alſo. For as I muſt needes confeſſe, that I haue read the former, &amp; indeauoured to follow ſome of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: ſo I leaue the learneder ſort to ſuch of them, as themſelues ſhall beſt like: only this for the more ignorant ſort I haue ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med at, to make the whole doctrine of faſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting eaſy and plaine, that they might with facility vnderſtand what god requireth of them in the day of faſt, and how they ought to behaue them ſelues therein: And to that end I haue ſet downe euery thing orderly, &amp; at large, &amp; therefore the more clearly: and not ſcholastically and ſhortly (as ſome haue done) and by that meanes the more obſcurely, eſpecially vnto the vulgar ſort:
<pb facs="tcp:15175:8" rendition="simple:additions"/> and I haue ſhewed the practiſe of euery particular, out of the Scripture, ſetting downe at large the wordes of euery text for the capacity of the ſimplest, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for the more eaſines and plainnes, hauing recourſe of purpoſe to the ſelfe ſame texts, rather then making choiſe of new, which vainly might happily haue bread ſome obſcuritie Which kind of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting if it may ſeeme to bring tediouſnes vnto the learned eares, they must conſider, that firſt I preached theſe ſermons to the meaner ſort, men not brought vp in lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and ſo did apply my ſelfe in hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of this doctrine vnto their capacity, leading them on in it according to their owne pace (which is rightly to diuide the word of God: and in his howſe (as a wiſe steward) to giue vnto euery one of them their owne food in due ſeaſon) and ſince, euen as they were then preached, I haue publiſhed them for their ſakes eſpecially, and ſo haue deliuered them as milke, for all thoſe that are but babes and children in Christ. And therefore if any of theſe

Therefore as the whole man conſiſteth of ſoule and bodie, but the ſoule is moſt principall, ſo doth this exerciſe of faſting conſiſt of theſe two parts, whereof this later appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the ſoule, is the cheefe. And as in the ſanctification of the Sabbath there are two things, the one to reſt from all bodily labour, (appertaining to the bodie) the other to ſanctifie that time of reſt (belonging chiefely to the ſoule) which is the principall end of the other: So in faſting there are theſe two things to be conſidered, the one to abſteine from all food, (which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly concerneth the body) the other is the end, why we vſe that abſtinence, which is to further our ſoules in godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which is the chiefeſt of all, and

And therefore vnto this abſtinence there hath beene alwais adioined, as a thing inſeparable, ſupplications &amp; praiers, which cannot be at all in any accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble maner without ſome hope and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance from God, that we ſhall bee heard.<note place="margin">And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore faſting is neuer without prayer.</note> As then in all maner of faſtes we muſt firſt cleerely ſee our ſins, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe them vnfainedly, and thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly iudge our ſelues for them; ſo muſt we then alſo with good hope in the goodneſſe of God for Chriſtes ſake praie earneſtly for the full pardon and forgiueneſſe of them, and for the turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away, or remoouing from vs all heauie iudgements, which are due to vs, or vpon vs for the ſame. So that this

               <p>And thus we ſhall find in holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that all the beſt ſeruants of God haue in their faſtings vſed ſolemne praier: and whereas praier is, &amp; ought to be a daily exerciſe of euery chriſtian man &amp; woman, euen as the Iewes had their daily morning and euening ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, which were not without praier: and as it is ſaide of <hi>Daniell,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dan. 6.10.</note> that it was his cuſtome to praie three times eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie day;<note place="margin">Yea earnest and feruent, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all praiers</note> in the daies of faſting they haue vſed a ſpeciall and extraordinarie kinde of praier, differing from all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that they haue vſed before, both in zeale and ſtrength of praier, and alſo in continuance. Therefore we in

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:15175:63" rendition="simple:additions"/> the teeth outward (as we ſay) at anie time, ſo then eſpecially they muſt not bee wearie, but conſider well what great neceſſitie there is of praier, both in reſpect of their ſinnes, and of the puniſhment of them; and ſo inforce themſelues to an earneſt kinde of long praier: as if a man were fallen into a deepe pit or well, he would crie out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud and long with all his ſtrength, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vntill he were hoarſe, or had loſt his voice, that ſo he might be heard, and holpen, and would not fauour himſelfe in ſuch a caſe.</p>
               <p>Thus it appeareth that when <hi>Ezra,</hi> and the reſt that feared God with him, faſted becauſe of the tranſgreſſion of them of the captiuitie, that hee praied verie earneſtly and long, as wee may gather both from his behauiour, and from the wordes that hee then vſed, which were full of great affection:<note place="margin">Ezra. 9.4.</note> for it is written of him, that he ſate downe aſtonied vntill the euening ſacrifice, and after the euening ſacrifice he aroſe
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:15175:64" rendition="simple:additions"/> vp from his heauineſſe, and when he had rent his clothes, &amp; his garments, he fell vpon his knees, and ſpread out his handes vnto the Lord God: and ſaide, O my God, I am confounded and aſhamed to lift vp mine eies vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee my God, for our iniquities are increaſed ouer our head, and our treſpaſſe is growen vp vnto the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and ſo foorth as it followeth in that praier of his, full of all humilitie and zeale. The like may be ſaid of the prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> who in the end of the ſeauentie yeeres of their captiuitie (vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding by bookes (as he ſaith of himſelfe) and namely by reading the Prophecie of <hi>Ieremie,</hi> that the number of yeeres which the Lord would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh for the deſtruction of <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> were now almoſt expired) and turned his face vnto the Lord,<note place="margin">Dan. 9.3.</note> by prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and ſupplications, with faſting and ſackcloth &amp; aſhes: and then how zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly &amp; feruently he praied, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peereth in the whole praier, in which
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:15175:64" rendition="simple:additions"/> he often breaks out into many paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate exclamatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: ſo eſpecially by the often doubling of the ſame petitions, which was no vaine babling in him, ful of words without any great matter, but did ariſe of the abundance of his earneſt deſire and great feeling that he had of that which he praied for: as when he ſaith;<note place="margin">Dan. 9.15.</note> O our God heare the praier of thy ſeruant, and his ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and cauſe thy face to ſhine vpon thy Sanctuarie, that lieth waſte, for the Lords ſake: O my God incline thine eare and heare, open thine eies and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold our deſolations, and the citie whereupon thy name is called; for we doe not preſent our ſupplications be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee for our owne righteouſneſſe, but for thy tender mercies: O Lorde heare, O Lord forgiue; O Lord conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and doe it, deferre not for thine owne ſake, O my God: for thy name is called vpon thy citie, and vpon thy people. Thus both of them praied ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie feruently and with great zeale,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:15175:65" rendition="simple:additions"/> which argued that they had great hope of obtaining their ſuites, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they would ſoone giuen them ouer, and not haue beene ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate. For it is moſt certaine, that according to the hope that we haue of obtaining any thing at the handes of God or man, ſo are our deſires and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtes vnto them more earneſt, or more cold, therfore when they praied thus importunately, it appeareth that in this great humilitie of theirs,<note place="margin">And by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie of praier the Lord will be ouercome.</note> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by their faſting and maner of it, they had great hope of obtaining their requeſts of God, vnto whom they did ſue. And thus muſt we doe in the day of our faſting, I ſaie we muſt labour for that meaſure of faith in gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe through the bleſſed merits of Chriſt our Sauiour, that might mooue vs to pray earneſtly, and as it were to crie mightily vnto God for the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing nowe at the laſt of this grieuous plague: that though wee haue iuſtlie deſerued it, and a great deale more,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:15175:65" rendition="simple:additions"/> yet for the Lords ſake it would pleaſe him vpon our true repentance, and earneſt ſeeking vnto him for mercie, to turne it away. Which if wee doe, then he vndoubtedly will heare vs in his good time, as hee hath witneſſed vnto vs in the Goſpell by the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, both of the wicked Iudge,<note place="margin">Luk. 18.2.</note> who by the importunity of the widow, was ouercome at the laſt, to doe her right; and this was propounded (as Chriſt himſelfe faith) to this end to teach men to pray often, and not to waxe faint; whereupon he inferreth this generall doctrine.<note place="margin">verſ. 6.7.</note> Heare what the vnrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Iudge ſaith: and ſhall not God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge his elect, which crie daie and night vnto him, though hee ſuffered long for them? So God will heare thoſe that crie daie and night, that is that praie earneſtly and continuallie: And againe in the other parable of the man that came to his friend at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night to borrow three loues,<note place="margin">Luk. 11.5.</note> who though he was vnwilling at the firſt,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:15175:66" rendition="simple:additions"/> yet becauſe of his importunitie did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe, &amp; gaue him as many as he would<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereupon hee maketh this generall promiſe to al thoſe that ſhal thus ſeeke vnto God, that is, earneſtly and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ceaſing, that he will heare them, ſaying: Aske, and it ſhal be giuen you, ſeeke and yee ſhall finde, knocke and it ſhall be opened vnto you: for euerie one that asketh receaueth, and he that ſeeketh findeth, and to him that knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it ſhall be opened; that is, if yee ſeeke and aske after this maner. So by theſe examples wee may be aſſured, that God will heare vs for this thing, if we pray vnto him eatneſtly, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ceaſing, though we haue hitherto ſeene little ſucceſſe of our praiers, for the plague is not only not taken away, but is greatly increaſed euery where.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">He often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth to giue, that we might bee quickened vp to fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uencie of prayer.</note>And truely the Lord doeth manie times deferre of purpoſe, to grant that which we aske, and which alſo he hath promiſed, and is purpoſed to giue, that we might be mooued in the feeling of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:15175:66" rendition="simple:additions"/> our want to pray earneſtly for it: and that the want of it for a time might quicken vp our dead hearts, and dull ſpirits vnto greater feruencie of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: that alſo when we ſhall ſee that we haue ſuch things giuen vnto vs, and that wee haue obtained them by our prayer, yea by long and earneſt prayer, wee might make the more account of them, and eſteeme them as we ought, and alſo be ſo much the more thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vnto God for the ſame. For the Lord indeed hath of his great mercie promiſed, that if we call vpon him, he will heare vs, as we haue learned euen now out of the Goſpell of <hi>S.

Nowe which is the
<pb facs="tcp:15175:67" rendition="simple:additions"/> moſt conuenient time for God to help vs in,<note place="margin">Act. 1.7.</note> that we muſt not preſcribe vnto him, neither is it alwayes meet for vs to know the times or the ſeaſons which the Father hath put in his own power: therefore as they be beſt knowen to his heauenly Maieſtie, ſo wee muſt leaue the declaration of them to him alone, not doubting, but that he will heare vs in due time, euen in affliction. Hee doth deferre many times of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe for good cauſes: both that wee might be ſtirred vp thereby to pray to him earneſtly and continually, not doubting one whit of the trueth of his promiſes; and that when we haue our requeſts granted, we might eſteeme of ſo great a benefit, and be thankefull to him for the ſame. For aſſuredly if wee did alwayes finde, that the Lord did giue vs euery thing at the firſt asking (though wee graunt that hee giueth vs continually more than we aske) ſuch is our vnthankefulneſſe, that both wee would come vnto him very coldly, and
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:15175:67" rendition="simple:additions"/> pray drowſilie (for wee would make it but an ordinarie matter,<note place="margin">Therefore if we conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, the Lord will heare vs at the laſt.</note> Aske &amp; haue) and alſo wee would not ſo highlie e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme of the things giuen vnto vs, nor labor to be ſo thankfull to him for the ſame, as our bounde duty did require. Therfore concerning all other things, and namely, this preſent viſitation of the Plague, the more that the Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth to take it away, the more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt let vs be in prayer, and let not the delay of it quench the heat of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire one whit, but kindle it more and more, and I do aſſure you in the word of the Lord, that if we faint not in prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but lift vp our hearts and hands ſtill vnto the Throne of his Mercy, that he will in time heare vs, and ſhew mercie vnto vs; and that he will not onely do ſo, but he will make it manifeſt and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant vnto the very ſoules and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of vs all.</p>

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:15175:71"/> with God in his praier, as was declared vnto him in the viſion of wreſtling, and ſhould preuaile againſt <hi>Eſau,</hi> and al other his enimies, but how he did and ſhould heereafter preuaile with God, and obtaine all things of him the viſion did ſhew, namely, that hee praied ſo feruently and ſo continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally that he did not giue ouer vntil he had ſome aſſurance from the Lord by his holie ſpirit, that he had heard him, and would defend &amp; bleſſe him, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnto his own deſire,<note place="margin">Gen. 32.9.</note> &amp; the Lords promiſe. Thus muſt wee alſo ſtriue with the Lord in our praiers, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaketh to the <hi>Romanes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 15.30</note> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth of them, that they would ſtriue with him by praier to God for him: and we muſt put all our ſtrength to it, as <hi>Iacob</hi> did, when he wreſtled with the angel. And to ſee it againe more cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the ſame compariſon: As a man that wreſtleth for the beſt game will put all his might and skill to it, and wil not giue ouer as long as he hath anie
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:15175:71"/> thing in himſelfe, that he might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile: ſo muſt we in our praiers bee ſo earneſt &amp; importunate with the Lord, that we riſe not vp from praier, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part away from him, vntill hee haue bleſſed vs: and the harder that we find it to obtaine anie thing becauſe of our ſinnes, the more earneſtly muſt wee ſtriue in praier for it. Therefore now in thee daies of faſting let vs ſtirre vp our ſelues vnto praier, and ſtriue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all vnfitneſſe, that might hinder vs, and as for other things, ſo that this great mortalitie might haue an end, without which feruencie of praier, all our faſting is nothing woorth.</p>
               <p>Seeing then that feruencie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance in praier is ſo proper vnto the time of faſting (as we haue heard) and it is ſpecially vndertaken to that end:<note place="margin">The papiſts had no ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall praier vpon their faſting daies.</note> we may ſee by this alſo how farre the church of Rome &amp; al Papiſts, are from the true faſt preſcribed in Gods word, &amp; practiſed of this ſeruants (thogh they would be thought to be the onely

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:15175:81" rendition="simple:additions"/> and that moſt grieuouſly, yet he would ſtay his heauy hand and beſtow ſome bleſſing vpon them: where in ſaying, Who knoweth, or who can tell? his meaning is nothing leſſe than to call it into queſtion, or any wayes to make them doubt of it, but rather to conſider the hardneſſe of the thing, and ſo to ſeeke for it the more earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they might haue ſome hope of it: as if he had ſayd, Seeing God is ſo mercifull, as he had ſpoken of him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, calling him, Gratious, ſlow to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and of great kindnes, and one that repenteth him of the euill, there is no doubt of the thing, but that if they could humble themſelues as he requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and pray earneſtly, though he had begun to puniſh them already, yet hee would repent and ſpare them. As alſo it is ſayd in the Prophet <hi>Jona,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iona 3.9.</note> by the King of <hi>Nineue</hi> (who proclaimed a faſt, and willed all men to put on ſacke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth, and to crie mightily vnto the Lord, and euery man to turne from his

               <p>Therefore that we might doe this that we doe in faith,<note place="margin">Which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes wee muſt at this preſent ſet before our eyes.</note> I meane continue ſtill to faſt and pray, and not giue it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, or wax wearie of it, as of our ſelues wee are too prone vnto it: yea that in thus abſtaining, wee might pray ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:15175:83" rendition="simple:additions"/> vnto God, to ſtay his heauie hand, and to put an happie end at the laſt vnto this long and great mortality, Let vs conſider that euen this promiſe is made to vs, and written for this very time, and for this purpoſe, that if in this faſting euery man will turne from all his ſinnes with his whole heart, and be ſorie for them euen from the very bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of his heart: that the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe will repent of all that euill that he hath begun to do vnto vs; and though hee hath taken away many thouſands alreadie, yet he will ſpare the reſt, and leaue ſome euery where to praiſe his Name.

And this vndoubtedly is ſet downe for our conſolation, and inſtruction, to ſhew vs, what in the like caſe we may looke for: And truely it muſt needes be ſo, for there is no reſpect of perſons with God, and the promiſes of his worde though ſpoken vnto ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular people, vpon ſome occaſion, yet are for all ages and times, and doe generally belong to all alike, vpon the

Therefore when as it ſaide to them, Turne vnto the Lorde with all your heart, and rent your hearts, and when you are thus hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, the Lord will returne for your good, and ſo foorth, as it followeth in that place, it is ſpoken not to them onely, but to all ſuch, as in the like caſe ſhall thus do: and ſo vnto vs now, that we may be aſſured, that if we thus do, in that meaſure that we doe it in truth, we ſhall finde mercie with the Lorde, and ſo may praie for it moſt earneſtlie in faith, as they were willed to doe.</p>

               <p>Beſides wee may conſider of that woorthy example of Gods mercy this way ſhewed vpon thoſe that humbled themſelues by faſting and praier in the daies of <hi>Iehoſhaphat,</hi> that good King of <hi>Iudah,</hi> as it is ſet downe in the ſecond booke of the <hi>Chronicles:</hi>

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:15175:88" rendition="simple:additions"/> which they tooke for themſelues, till they could carie no more: and were three daies in gathering of the ſpoile, for it was much: and in the fourth day they praiſed God in the valley of <hi>Bera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chah;</hi> which from that day had the name of that action, for there they bleſſed and praiſed God for the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, which he had giuen them, and ſo called it the valley of bleſſing or praiſe: and ſo they returned home to <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> with great ioy.

So that both for the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of the word, and for prayer all was extraordinarie: and ſo ought it to bee among vs, that we ſhould not onely do as we do, namely, twiſe a day, once in the forenoone and againe in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone, but wee ſhould continue both the times longer than we do, and haue more exerciſes of the Word, and of prayer, if wee were able, or had more helpe: as it is ſayd in this Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Iewes they had: for the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uites are reckoned vp by name, who ſpake, euen <hi>Ieſhua,</hi> and <hi>Bani, Kadmiel,</hi>

               <p>For though we obtaine many things daily at the mercifull hands of our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly father by our ordinarie prayers publike and priuate: yet he hath made the largeſt promiſes of bleſſing vnto fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting and prayer, and greateſt things haue been obtained that way of all the ſeruaunts of God.<note place="margin">Math. 17.14.</note> For as Chriſt ſayd vnto his Diſciples, to whom a certaine man brought his ſonne poſſeſſed with a deuill, but they could not caſt him out, and they demanded of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, why they could not doe it:<note place="margin">Many thing are not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thoſe prayers, whereunto faſting is adioyned.</note> This kinde is not caſt out but by prayer and faſting: that is, a moſt feruent kinde of prayer, whereunto faſting is to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned, to quicken vs vp thereunto: that it might be as it were a whetſtone to ſharpen our dull ſpirits, and to ſet an edge upon our blunt hearts. So that wee may eaſily perceiue, that ſome things, yea many things that we ſtand in need of, are not obtained, or euils re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooued,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:15175:132" rendition="simple:additions"/> without this kinde of prayer whereunto faſting is adioyned. For as ſome things are not to be had without a great price, nor many ſutes obtained of great men without long and earneſt ſupplication: ſo ſome things are not to bee receiued from God without thoſe feruent prayers and ſupplications which can not be without faſting, nor without that hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble proſtrating of our ſelues, which is wrought in vs by that meanes. And thus we are taught, that wee ought to haue vſed priuatelie this part of Gods ſeruice a great deale more than wee haue done; whereby we might haue brought into our hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes more bleſſings, and have kept out more afflictions, than now wee haue. But indeed the ignorance of the moſt part is ſo lamentable,<note place="margin">By reaſon of their great ignorance many are vnfit for priuate faſts.</note> that if they ſhuld not onely haue thus done before, but ſhould now vpon the hearing of this doctrine heerafter determine for ſome good cauſe beſt knowen unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, to take this exerciſe vpon them,

So that it would fall out with them, as with thoſe, of whom our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt ſpeaketh in the Goſpell,<note place="margin">Luk. 5.36.</note> that they ſhould not only not be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered thereby, but made worſe: euen as if a piece of a new garment were put into an olde veſture, then the new ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it, and the piece taken out of the new agreeth not with the olde: or as if new wine were put into olde veſſels, the new wine would breake the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and it would run out, and the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels would periſh. By which parables he teacheth vs, that faſting unfitly vſed of them that are not meet for it, nor onely maketh them worſe, but vtterlie deſtroyeth them.

For beſides that the man and woman are ſo neerely vnited by the bond of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, as by the couenant of God,<note place="margin">Prou. 2.17. Math. 19.5. 1.

For ſeeing the day of faſt is to be kept holie, and being of the nature of the Sabbath, as hath beene prooued before, in it they muſt wholly reſt from all the works of their ordinarie calling from euening to euening, and muſt ſpend that time in the worſhip of God; they can not at their owne will and pleaſure giue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer theſe workes, and ſo conſequently not appoint vnto themſelues a day of reſting; but muſt be contented heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to be ordered by the diſcretion of thoſe, to whom they haue either by the bond of nature or by ſome coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant wholly addicted themſelues and all their labours: and therefore they can not make choiſe of a day of priuate faſting (for of that we ſpeake, and not of publike, wherein both maſter and ſeruant muſt be at the appointment of their gouernour) but ſo farre onely, as their ſuperiours ſhall giue them leaue.
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:15175:134" rendition="simple:additions"/> So that if they can not, or wil not ſpare their labours for a time, they are of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie to keepe all their priuate faſts vpon the Sabbath dayes, wherein they are bound to reſt from their labours, and to ſerue God as well as any other: and ſo their maſters and gouernours ſhould not onely giue them leaue to doe, but alſo are charged by God ſo to doe, and haue authoritie giuen ouer them to that end; according to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe words of the commandement. Sixe dayes ſhalt thou labour,<note place="margin">Exod. 20.9.</note> and doe all thy worke, but the ſeuenth day it is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God, in it thou ſhalt not doe any worke, thou nor thy ſonne, nor thy daughter, thy man ſeruant, nor thy maide: where they are willed, not only not to hinder them from ſanctifying of the day, but to looke diligentlie vnto them, that they doe religiouſly obſerue and keepe it: and ſo vpon that day they may at any time (the times of neceſſitie being alwaies excepted) without any offence
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:15175:135" rendition="simple:additions"/> to their gouernors (by defrauding the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their ſeruices) keepe their faſts. And ſo may they doe any day of the weeke els: if they haue their leaue; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe not. For though this be a ſpeciall part of Gods ſeruice, and that which he requireth of all at one time or other, yet becauſe it is not ordinarie, and the ſixe dayes are appointed for all the works of our ſeuerall callings ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and they are not their owne men (as we ſay) but at the diſpoſition of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, euen of their gouernours; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hath giuen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> leaue to breake all ſuch purpoſes of theirs, as ſhall vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any of theſe dayes hinder them from any of thoſe workes or ſeruices,<note place="margin">If they doe, their gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours haue power to breake them.</note> wherein they are to imploy them, and vſe them.

<pb facs="tcp:15175:146" rendition="simple:additions"/> the people ſhould come to the houſe of God to that end.

Thus we ſee when this huge armie of the Ammonites &amp; Moabites, and mount Seir did but come vp againſt Ieruſalem at the firſt hearing of it, though yet nothing was done, neither were they come to them conſidering what was likely to be the euent of that warre, if they had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, and if the Lord had not hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen them, he proclaimed a faſt, and did thus ſeeke to eſcape that, which was like to come.
