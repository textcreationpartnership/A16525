            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Whereby it came to pa≈ø≈øe, that both here, and in many places els, there was much more preaching &amp; hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the word of God, and praying vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, then was before, and otherwi≈øe would haue beene. So that by meanes of the ≈øtraite charge laid vpon all by your L. letter, there was much good done in this countrie at that time, the fruite whereof
<pb facs="tcp:15175:3" rendition="simple:additions"/> I hope, remaineth vnto this day. For though the booke containing the cau≈øe and order of tho≈øe fa≈øts, which was made by ≈øome of the cheife gouernours in the Church of England, and was authorized by the Kings Highne≈ø≈øe, did (as I take it) not onely giue leaue vnto all places pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely to meete vpon the≈øe aboue named daies to the≈øe ends, but did inioyne them to it: and ≈øo all men might haue taken knowledge of it, and of their dutie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in from thence: e≈øpecially when the cau≈øe of it (namely ≈øo grieuous, and ≈øo vniuer≈øall a plague) was ≈øo notorious, that it could not be hid from any: yet it was found too true by experience in many places, that vntill ≈øuch time as men were further cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vpon by your Lord≈øhips letter, full of great and weightie rea≈øons to per≈øwade thereunto, that neither many mini≈øters had any care to call vpon their people to ≈øo holy and nece≈ø≈øarie a ≈øeruice, nor the people any great deuotion to come: So ≈ølowe are men vnto any part of Gods ≈øeruice, yea though it doth ≈øo greatly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
<pb facs="tcp:15175:4" rendition="simple:additions"/> them, e≈øpecially to this principall part of it in fa≈øting and praier (which hath beene very long out of v≈øe) that they had neede not onely lightly to be called vpon, but with many ≈øtrong coards violently hailed vnto it: though vnto all matters of the world, they are ≈øo forward and ha≈øtie, that they runne of their own accord, and none can ≈øtay them. Hereupon it hath come to pa≈ø≈øe, that a great part of the good, that this way hath beene done vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the people of God, and ≈øeruice to his maie≈øtie, is to be imputed vnto your lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhips diligent care, who did ≈øo timely, and effectually ≈øtirre vp men vnto it: e≈øpecially in re≈øpect of tho≈øe cheife places &amp; others, vnder your Lord≈øhips iuri≈ødiction, which then were greatly ≈øubiect vnto this vi≈øita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as well as other parts of this land, neither are they all of them yet free from it. Therefore the≈øe beeing part of my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours at that time, they are in ≈øome ≈øort due vnto your Lord≈øhip, by who≈øe means I receiued incouragement thereunto, as others did to the like. And I haue pre≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb facs="tcp:15175:4" rendition="simple:additions"/> to pre≈øent them vnto your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhip, that by them you may ≈øee, and by one may iudge of the re≈øt, how readie we are, and ≈øhall be, to yeild obedience to all your L. godly proceedings: promi≈øing for my ≈øelfe, and pre≈øuming of the re≈øt that when we ≈øhall be likewi≈øe comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded (which we expect, and hope for in time) to keepe ≈øolemne dayes of thank≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing for the mitigating of this plague in ≈øo great mea≈øure in the mo≈øt places, and for the cleane taking of it away in many, we will be, by the grace of God, as ready to performe that part of ≈øeruice, as we haue beene forward vnto this. And in the meane ≈øea≈øon according to our boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den duty we will indeauour not only pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatly to be thankfull vnto God, but vpon all ≈øuch daies, as we haue our publike a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øemblies, to doe it in ≈øome part, and to call vpon our people to be thankfull to God with vs, both in hart, words, and life: lea≈øt the Lord for our vnthankfulnes doe returne vpon vs with the ≈øame, or ≈øome other great puni≈øhment of his. Which
<pb facs="tcp:15175:5" rendition="simple:additions"/> we haue ≈øo much the more cau≈øe to feare, vnles we thus ≈øeeke to preuent it, becau≈øe the late memory of ≈øo great a worke, both of iu≈øtice in ≈øending the plague, and of mercy in taking it away, is not ≈øo fre≈øh &amp; effectuall with all men, nay with very few, as it ≈øhould: but they like to vngratious children ≈øo ≈øoone forget the rodd, as it is off their back. And ≈øeeing by the≈øe your Lord≈øhip may take knowledge, that by your godly incitation many were made more painfull in their callings (at the lea≈øt for that time) then otherwi≈øe they would have beene, whereby al≈øo God was more honoured, and the people more in≈øtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: your Lord≈øhip will according to that high place, wherein God hath placed you, e≈øpecially to that end, take all oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities by word and writing ≈øtill to incite all men to be zealous and feruent in the worke of the mini≈øtery: by giuing all good incouragement vnto the painfull la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers in Gods harue≈øt, and by quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vp them that are any way ≈ølothfull and negligent, and by di≈øcountenancing

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:15175:15" rendition="simple:additions"/> and then all things are done to an other end, euen that there might be great humiliation in them for their ≈øinnes, (which two are not ≈øo proper vnto the Sabbath) and ≈øo vpon their repentance God might be reconciled vnto them, and ≈øpare them; which are mo≈øt excellent ends of fa≈øting, and a great fruit of that worke, which might prouoke all vnto it, and none might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent them of their labour.</p>
